# Csv_reader_project

CSV Reader Project
This project is a Python program that reads student data from a CSV file and processes it in a structured way.
The program displays student names, ages, and scores in a formatted table. It also calculates the total number of students and the average score. Based on their scores, students are categorized into high, middle, and low performance groups.
The script includes error handling to manage missing files, empty CSV files, missing columns, and invalid score values. This makes the program safe and reliable to use.
